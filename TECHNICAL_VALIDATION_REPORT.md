## 📋 RECOMMENDED EXPANSION COMMAND

```bash
# Safe 50-product expansion command
cd "/Users/yogi/Desktop/basarometer/v5/scan bot"
node basarometer-scanner.js --site rami-levy --limit 50 --confidence-threshold 0.7

# Monitor and validate results
python3 -c "
import json
with open('output/basarometer-scan-[timestamp].json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
print(f'Products extracted: {len(data[\"products\"])}')
print(f'Average confidence: {sum(p[\"confidence\"] for p in data[\"products\"])/len(data[\"products\"]):.3f}')
"
```
