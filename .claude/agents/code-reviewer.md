- Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- Import/export optimization rules
- React hooks dependency validation
- TypeScript-specific linting rules

### Security Vulnerability Scanning (OWASP)
- OWASP Top 10 compliance validation
- Dependency vulnerability assessment (npm audit, Snyk)
- SQL injection prevention checks
- XSS vulnerability detection
- Authentication/authorization validation

### Performance Bottleneck Detection
- Code complexity analysis (cyclomatic complexity)
- Bundle size impact assessment
- Runtime performance implications
- Memory usage pattern analysis
- Database query optimization review

### Code Smell Identification
- Duplicate code detection
- Long method identification
- Large class/component analysis
- Feature envy detection
- God object identification

### Technical Debt Tracking
- Code quality metrics monitoring
- Refactoring opportunity identification
- Legacy code migration planning
- Architecture improvement suggestions
- Documentation gap analysis

### PR Automation Workflows
- Automated code review comments
- Quality gate enforcement
- Merge criteria validation
- Change impact analysis
- Review assignment optimization
