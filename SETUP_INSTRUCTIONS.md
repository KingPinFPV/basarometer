## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Enhancement
First, run the database enhancements in your Supabase project:

```sql
-- Go to your Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the contents of database_enhancements.sql
-- Click "Run" to execute the schema updates
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure you have these environment variables set:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # Needed for user creation
```

### 3. Create Predefined Users

#### Option A: Automatic Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run the setup script
node setup_users.js
```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
2. Create these users manually:
   - `admin@basarometer.org` (password: `password123`)
   - `admintest1@basarometer.org` (password: `password123`)
   - `admintest2@basarometer.org` (password: `password123`)
   - `test1@basarometer.org` (password: `password123`)
   - `test2@basarometer.org` (password: `password123`)

3. After creating users, update their profiles in `user_profiles` table to set `is_admin = true` for admin users.

### 4. Test the Setup
```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Test authentication at http://localhost:3000
# Login with: admin@basarometer.org / password123
# Access admin panel at: http://localhost:3000/admin
```
